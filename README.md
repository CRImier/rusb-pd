# Radio USB-PD
Giving a modern touch to my SWL receiver made by Yaesu, the FRG7700, i came up with this idea while i was looking at the manual and noticed there was a "DC Power mod" available for the radio.
The parts for this aren't being sold much anymore, all i could find was a listing on ebay and it cost about 36 dollars for the whole kit + 30 dollars more to ship to EU.
The final result is these two boards, i figured there wasn't much space inside the chassis for an additional board but i did what i could, the first features a vertical usb-c connector and is made so it can be mounted to the chassis connecting to the other board with 90 degree headers.
The second board features a microcontroller (CH32V003), pd controller (FUSB302) and a pi filter for filtering out any noise incoming from the external psu.
